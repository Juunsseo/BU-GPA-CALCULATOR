# BU-GPA-CALCULATOR

The GPA Calculatorâ€™s user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring no prior instruction for use. It features a simple layout with clearly labeled input fields for GPA and credit hours, and straightforward buttons for adding courses, calculating the GPA, and resetting data. The feedback is immediate and understandable; for instance, once a course is added or the GPA is calculated, the result is displayed directly below the form.
