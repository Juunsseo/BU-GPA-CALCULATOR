The GPA Calculator’s user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring no prior instruction for use.


It features a simple layout with clearly labeled input fields for GPA and credit hours, and straightforward buttons for adding courses, calculating the GPA, and resetting data.


The feedback is immediate and understandable; for instance, once a course is added or the GPA is calculated, the result is displayed directly below the form.


We developed this web application because our school only provides letter grades.

---

We used Python with Flask, Javascript, and HTML.
